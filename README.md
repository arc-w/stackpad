This project is homework from my university. The code is my solution. Here is the description:  
You are working as an editor in a press agency. The workload has lately increased significantly
and your managers regularly ask for changes to the contents before publication. Your task is to
digitize the writing and editing process of articles, from adding text to changing it, before they are
released into the media.  
Functionalities need to be:  
• Insert: Add text at a specified position  
• Delete: Remove a substring from a specified position  
• Undo: Revert the last operation (whether insert or delete)  
• Redo: Reapply an operation that was undone  
The undo and redo functionalities must be implemented using two instances of the chosen data
structure (DS) type.  
You must define a structure to record the operations. The struct must contain:  
● Operation type: INSERT or DELETE  
● Position: The index in the text where the operation occurs  
● Text: The text that was inserted or deleted  
Hints:  
● I/O operations will be handled via the console
